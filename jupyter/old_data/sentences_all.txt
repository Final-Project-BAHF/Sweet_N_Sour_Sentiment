(NYSE:CMG) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 22, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Brian Niccol|answer

(NYSE:CMG) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 22, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Brian Niccol|answer
131||So this is really just one of these temporary things, whereas we take advantage of an opportunity with the Chipotlane, which really I think it is a terrific outcome because it will drive our digital results as well as drive the total business, which hopefully as we’ve seen to date will result in even better returns going forward as we build out the new units.|CMG|Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 22, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Brian Niccol|answer
132||So no plan to slowdown, if anything, our guidance was intended to inform people we’re going to be increasing.|CMG|Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 22, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Brian Niccol|answer

138||But here’s what it is, I think we can give you some interesting facts on it, which is our digital business is roughly 50% bigger and the driver of that additional growth is our order ahead business, which as you know, it has got the best margin associated with our business going forward.|CMG|Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 22, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Brian Niccol|answer
139||So we loved the composition of the sales and we love the economics associated with new units, whether they have Chipotlanes or not.|CMG|Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 22, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Brian Niccol|answer

147||I think you mentioned that October so far has been strong and you’re expecting maybe that to ease, as it is cycle tougher comparisons coming up.|CMG|Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 22, 2019  4:30 PM ET|David Tarantino|question
148||So could you maybe just elaborate on what you’re seeing in October so we have the right context for the rest of the quarter?|CMG|Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 22, 2019  4:30 PM ET|David Tarantino|question

155||The guidance that we’re giving for the fourth quarter though it takes into account the strong comps as we start the quarter, but also that our strongest comp month last year was December, so going up against the tougher comparison in December.|CMG|Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 22, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Jack Hartung|answer
156||That’s when we had the delivery bowls and those were very, very successful.|CMG|Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 22, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Jack Hartung|answer

335|| Yes, Sharon on the investment, the investments about an extra $75,000 to add Chipotlanes, that would be for like an end-cap building.|CMG|Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 22, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Jack Hartung|answer
336||It’s the same $75,000 on a free standard, but a free standard just cost more than an end-cap.|CMG|Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 22, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Jack Hartung|answer
337||So our emphasis so far has been on getting the vast majority of our sites should be on the end-cap.|CMG|Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 22, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Jack Hartung|answer
338||We’re trying to get as many end-caps with Chipotlanes as possible, that’s why we’ve been able to pretty quickly pivot so that we can have more than half of our portfolio.|CMG|Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.

1292|| Yeah.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1293||So Steve when we talk about the spare engines in the quarter specific as it relates to spares to GECAS the corporate elimination was just under $100 million this quarter and we are seeing spare engine shipments higher in the quarter about half of that now back on Aviation about half of that relates to LEAP.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer

1295||And overall, if you look at the levels we're seeing in 2019 for spare engine shipments they are up over 2018, but we expect them to be about flat as we go into 2020.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer

1300||So that's why you see the step up here in the back half relative to the sales of spares to GECAS and others.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Larry Culp|answer

1435||I think, we are in turn planning conservatively here for the fourth quarter, just given those trends and some of the uncertainty in China right now around the relatively more short-cycle nature of Healthcare broadly, certainly in our business.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Larry Culp|answer

1446||Just my question on the Power business.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Julian Mitchell|question
1447||It looked like Gas Power lost about $100 million of EBIT in Q3.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Julian Mitchell|question
1448||Just looking at that business in particular on the service piece perhaps, I think Jamie you'd called out Power Services productivity being an issue.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Julian Mitchell|question
1449||So maybe give more color there and how quickly you think you can improve that productivity on the service piece?|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Julian Mitchell|question
1450||And following up on Power Portfolio, maybe Larry, is there any kind of time frame around which you think about just an outright exit from pieces of it versus continuously trying to improve what you have?|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Julian Mitchell|question
1451|| So, Julian, I'll talk a little bit about Power Services and maybe I'll touch on some of the top line as well as some of the margin elements of it, and I'll break it into the three pieces.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1452||So Gas Power services, in the contractual book we actually have been seeing factored fired hours up.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer

1454||We're seeing good utilization.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1455||But we were impacted in the quarter, both by outage counts being down as well as by different mix of outages.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1456||And so the major inspection outages were down as well, which really impacts how we think about what flows through.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1457||In this book, we're really focused on cost to serve, meaning outage execution, how do we think about working capital management related to that.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1458||And that all brings it down to how do we continue to work closely with our customers, but accrete margin over time.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1459||The second piece, the transactional book, we are seeing revenue down.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1460||But that is remixing to higher margin.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1461||And we see that coming through, as we've refocused the team on price, higher-margin work.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1462||In transactional, what is gaining revenue a bit here is some fulfillment issues and operations and we've mentioned some of the operational issues we've had earlier in the year.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1463||They continue and that's something that Scott and his team and Larry have really been deep diving and focused on how that execution path really shifts up.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1464||Upgrades, we see good demand.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer

1467||But if you pull back on services in total, expect a more positive profile in the fourth quarter.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1468||But we still see full year as slightly down which is a little bit different than what we were seeing maybe a couple of quarters ago.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1469|| I would just say, with respect to the strategic question around Power Portfolio, it's important to remember that when you hear us talk about driving a lean transformation of these businesses, better upfront discipline around which projects we take on, how we price them, how we framed risk, let alone how we execute and how we support them in the aftermarket.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Larry Culp|answer
1470||But that is not necessarily a strategic call once and for all time, right?|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Larry Culp|answer
1471||I think our view is, we wanted to make sure we had an integrated steam business, both in equipment and services.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Larry Culp|answer

1475||I think over time, those operational improvements will frankly expand the strategic optionality we have in and around each of those businesses, let alone the Power Portfolio as a whole.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Larry Culp|answer
1476||If and when we do something we'll have that discussion internally before we have it publicly.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Larry Culp|answer

1491||And probably the most important to really look at is the second half non-repeat of the Power charges.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1492||So we took well over $1 billion of charges in the second half last year.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1493||You saw this in the third quarter performance.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer

1495||The second is continued strength in aviation services and the aftermarket there.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1496||Military helps but both of those two things really help us.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1497||We are seeing the LEAP/Passport impact in the transition but still largely very healthy at Aviation.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1498||At Healthcare, we've got biopharma growth and continued cost control at HCS.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer

1508|| Hey, Just a question.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|John Inch|question
1509||Rough calculations, Larry, Jamie for Aviation suggesting maybe sitting on a pretty sizable cash advance built up over the years.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|John Inch|question
1510||First does that create kind of future cash headwind?|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|John Inch|question
1511||And when will that start?|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|John Inch|question
1512||And then second just thinking out loud.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|John Inch|question
1513||If customers start to cancel the MAX not all of them but maybe some, considering you've received sort of large cash advances I think it's like half the final bill for engine production, do you have to give the money back?|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|John Inch|question
1514||Or how exactly does that work?|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|John Inch|question
1515||Thank you.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|John Inch|question
1516|| Yes.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1517||So let me talk a little bit about MAX first and then I'll talk about allowances and discounts on the payable that's built up there.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1518||So first on the MAX, we still expect this year to be impacted to the tune of about negative $1.4 billion.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1519||When we think about how that comes through in future periods it is really difficult to predict.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1520||A lot of this is going to depend on exactly how the reentry into service works.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1521||And specifically, logistics, production, scheduling there's just multiple variables here around the ultimate delivery schedule of Boeing planes to customers.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1522||So that's maybe -- as you think about 2020 there's multiple scenarios that could play out there.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1523||When I really pivot to looking at Aviation free cash flow specifically, for 2019 negative one, four [ph] for the 737, we have seen that in our planning cycle largely offset by two things: One is accrued allowances and discounts, which is basically a situation where when we sell engines we've got contracts with both air framers and airlines and when the discounts are offered on these engines, the payment for the engine can be from the airframer but the payment for the discount can be paid separately to the airline.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1524||And they have a lot of timing variability depending on how programs are launching and different production schedules.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1525||We have seen accrued allowances and discounts build this year and we had expected at the half for that to largely reverse this year.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1526||Now based on where we are right now, we're expecting a little more than half of that 737 MAX deficit to be made up by this build in payables that then will push into 2020 and shift back down to your point.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1527||The other part where we're seeing strength in Aviation free cash flow is as I mentioned before, just the Aviation aftermarket and services side of things.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1528||Just nice cash flow continuing to come through there better than we expected.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1529||So hopefully that gives you the sense for 2019.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1530||And again, 2020, MAX a little bit TBD and we do expect that accrued discounts and allowances to also shift downward, which we'll see some pressure there but some goodness from MAX, hopefully.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jamie Miller|answer
1531|| John, I think that obviously, we didn't come into this year expecting what has played out in that regard.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Larry Culp|answer
1532||Again our primary focus is to support Boeing and our carrier customers with respect to what they return to service.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Larry Culp|answer
1533||But with respect to the cash flows in this business, we had over $4 billion last year despite some of the MAX dynamics, as Jamie just outlined.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Larry Culp|answer
1534||I think we are encouraged by the work the team has done this year.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Larry Culp|answer
1535||And going forward, given our market leadership position, the installed base, the new engines we have coming online not only commercially, but frankly the growing military business that we have, the opportunities to drive lean at Aviation, particularly with respect to improving inventory turnover and on-time delivery, I just think there's a lot of potential here given the secular tailwinds in Aviation, our position in the space to build off this cash flow base that we delivered last year.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Larry Culp|answer
1536||And hopefully, we'll deliver this year for many years to come.|GE|General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Larry Culp|answer

1971||The new guidance $4.50 to $4.80, you’re correct, we've subtracted the $2 and arrived at, so it’s the original guidance we gave in January less $2 on the upper end we clipped it by $0.20 as you’ve seen we’ve -- its’ been quite a volatile environment in China as well as the microeconomic of volatility we’re seeing in South America as well the FX environment that we saw earlier in the year, when we gave our guidance was very different from the FX picture that we have today, which is offsetting some of that as well.|GM|General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 29, 2019 10:00 AM ET|Dhivya Suryadevara|answer

(NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|presentation
2084||So if you look to Page 5 or Slide 5, we had $10.5 billion of net outflows in the Americas, majority of this is attributable to the retail business.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|presentation
2085||On the next page, we drilled down on this a little more.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|presentation
2086||So on Slide 6, we show that 2019 history of monthly gross sales and net flows for the Invesco and Oppenheimer U.S. active, retail products combined, which includes periods of both pre and post-close.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|presentation

2088||I think there are few important takeaways from this chart.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|presentation
2089||First, gross sales post-close are increasing, we see a positive trend line.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|presentation
2090||However, while gross sales are improving, they’re not yet to the pre-deal level.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|presentation
2091||So there is obviously more room for improvement.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|presentation
2092||Second, the chart clearly highlights that the deal has had an impact on our gross sales levels.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|presentation
2093||Integration of two sales team are well underway, and in fact, going quite well, but they’re not yet complete.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|presentation
2094||And as the integration is completed, we would expect the gross sales levels to come back to at least the pre-acquisition levels.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|presentation
2095||And, third point, net outflows have been more elevated post-close.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|presentation
2096||But this is largely a function of the abnormally low gross sales level I just mentioned.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|presentation
2097||And we’d expect net flows to improve as we complete all phases of the sales integration work through this year and into 2020.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|presentation
2098||While staying on the topic of flows but moving away from U.S. retail, I’d like to point out that we continue to see a strong institutional pipeline.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|presentation

2104||The next – let me move to the topic of expense synergies.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|presentation
2105||If you’ll recall, we have been projecting to achieve run rate net expense synergies of $475 million by the end of the first quarter of 2021.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|presentation

2108||We already saw that the opportunity to stay more than $475 million by the time of the transaction closing, we only had a clear line of sight, regarding the $475 million in savings.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|presentation
2109||After we closed the deal, we were able to look deeper into the business and we started making significant progress on the integration.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|presentation
2110||And we now see that we can run the business with this slower expense base.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|presentation
2111||There is still further integration work to be completed, but we’re confident that we can deliver the higher level of expense synergy that we’re presenting to you today.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|presentation
2112||And as a reminder, the synergy level is net of investments made in areas that further strengthen our distribution and investment capabilities and processes and which allow us to drive future growth and avoid future cost.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|presentation
2113||We presented on Slide 9 of our deck summarizing these expense synergies, this illustrates the combined firms’ representative run rate, annual operating expense base.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|presentation

2115||So in summary, before we go to Q&A, let met just say that we see the potential for the long-term net flows to trend in the right direction, although that clearly not where we want them to be right now.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|presentation
2116||One of the key areas of outflows we’re experiencing is centered in U.S. retail space and that is largely due to the shortfall and gross sales that we expect will ultimately be corrected.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|presentation
2117||And as the U.S. retail sales teams complete their integration.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|presentation

2134||They're literally going through training right now.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Marty Flanagan|answer
2135||We actually as you always do have disruption when you do transfer agency conversions in the like, they'll probably be up and running, I'd say fully into December, so I think early next year.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Marty Flanagan|answer
2136||And the quality of the team is the best we've ever had.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Marty Flanagan|answer
2137||So we've viewed that the historical gross sales.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Marty Flanagan|answer

2139||Again, I'd put it in the context of Loren date of the – it all depends on the market, but with this market continues, that's what we foresee.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Marty Flanagan|answer

2142||I think the path to positive is going to be a function of some other things that are – some within our control and some without of our control.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|answer
2143||So one thing that is still very much weighing on our flow picture for the firm globally is sort of just the macro environment and some of the political uncertainty that exists, where we see risk off, it's affecting everybody.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|answer
2144||And so in Europe for example, that risk off behaviors drove driven flows into cash and in a way from active products.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|answer
2145||And that's something that we can control, but we're definitely looking to see hopefully some of these events becoming more clear, Brexit being the most obvious one.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|answer
2146||The other element that I think is moving in a positive direction and is an important precursor to flows is performance.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|answer
2147||And we've had some headwinds around performance that we're beginning to see sort of a turnaround and particularly in sort of recent months where you can see just how strong the comeback or the pullback in performances when we see some release on some of these macro topics for example, what we're seeing in terms of what's going on in Europe and the UK has a big impact on our UK business.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|answer

2217||But just when you look at some of the investments that you guys are making and now with Oppenheimer, on the platform, I know it's tough to predict, but do you see some areas that yes, like higher fee, like momentum or trends versus some of the areas that are going to pressure that fee rate overtime.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Mike Carrier|question
2218||Is any update on how you're thinking about that and then managing expenses with that mind?|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Mike Carrier|question

2227||And really there's just so much that's outside of our control in terms of the mix of products not to mention currency in markets.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|answer
2228||So we're probably not in a great position or we're probably more likely to refrain on providing guidance on fee rate going forward just because it is so dynamic.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|answer
2229||But I would say it's a real even fight in terms of the things that are sort of helping us on the fee rate on the positive side versus things that may be putting it to the flip side.|IVZ|Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call  October 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET|Loren Starr|answer

3239||The one percentage point difference between next year's expected revenue growth and our ongoing growth model of 7% to 9% revenue growth is attributable to two things: number one the sale of our ownership interest in Thailand in mid-fiscal 2019; and number two an expected 7% to 8% decline in Channel Development's revenue as we lap certain items related to the Global Coffee Alliance that benefited the segment's top line growth in fiscal 2019.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|presentation

3261||So when you add it all up, our total revenue growth of 6% to 8% for fiscal 2020 is expected to translate into non-GAAP operating income growth of 8% to 10% consistent with our ongoing growth model.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|presentation
3262||We expect GAAP EPS in the range of $2.84 to $2.89, down slightly from fiscal 2019 due largely to the lap of the one-time gain attributable to the licensing of our Thailand operations.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|presentation

3265||As a reminder, we expect the lap of income tax rate favorability for fiscal 2019 will impact our quarter-to-quarter non-GAAP EPS growth in fiscal 2020 with Q1 being the lowest at flat to down slightly given a nine percentage point EPS growth headwind tied to last year's tax rate.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|presentation

3323|| Katherine, there's three key benefits of this new Mastrena machine that I want to really punctuate.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Kevin Johnson|answer
3324||Number one, is it can pull a triple shot espresso with one pull.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Kevin Johnson|answer
3325||Today in our older machines you have to pull a Doubleshot and then another single shot for any beverage that has three shots of espresso.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Kevin Johnson|answer
3326||So just that alone reduces the amount of time that a partner at the bar would need to take if they're preparing a beverage that has three shots of espresso in it.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Kevin Johnson|answer
3327||So that's number one big efficiency unlock.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Kevin Johnson|answer
3328||Number two, those machines have Internet of Things sensors built into them.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Kevin Johnson|answer
3329||And so we get telemetry data that comes into our support center.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Kevin Johnson|answer
3330||We can see every shot of espresso that's being pulled and we can see centrally if there is a machine that's out there that needs tuning or maintenance.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Kevin Johnson|answer
3331||And that allows us to improve the quality of the shots that we're pulling.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Kevin Johnson|answer
3332||And third, with the Deep Brew and our predictive analytics, we're going to be able to determine if a machine needs preventative maintenance on it before it breaks.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Kevin Johnson|answer
3333||And so that simplifies things for our partners.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Kevin Johnson|answer
3334||John you want to comment on the--|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Kevin Johnson|answer

3336||And I think the benefits that both Roz and Kevin hit on are important benefits that we're seeing translate into the international markets as well.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|John Culver|answer
3337||I would also just add that our partners absolutely love these machines and it gives them much more visibility to the customer due to the lower profile of the machine itself being able to interact with customers and engage with them.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|John Culver|answer

3351|| Yes, I think Jeffrey this -- what we're seeing in China is a direct result of the digital footprint that we've been able to build there as well as the meaningful innovation that we're bringing products in Modern Mixology and then the innovation that we're doing around our store footprint.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|John Culver|answer
3352||And digital obviously is moving very fast.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|John Culver|answer

3382||And then with respect to China, if you could just talk about investments there and maybe even the product mix, you talked about as being unfavorable.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Sara Senatore|question

3387||But why don't you go ahead and lead?|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Kevin Johnson|answer
3388|| Okay.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3389||Thank you, Kevin.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3390||Sara, what I'd like to do first is maybe just step -- take a step back and talk about Q4 in total.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3391||In my prepared remarks, I talked about consolidated margin across all of fiscal 2019.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3392||I'd like to focus more specifically on Q4 here, because the dynamics were a bit different.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3393||So, on a reported basis, our non-GAAP operating margin of 17.2% represented a 90 basis point decline compared to Q4 of last year.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3394||But what I would highlight is that embedded in that is a 70 basis point impact from our leadership conference as well as a 30 basis point impact from streamline-driven activities.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3395||So when you exclude those, our non-GAAP operating margin actually improved 20 basis points.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3396||Now I think your point, admittedly a 20 basis point margin improvement seems very modest in the context of a 5% global sales comp for the quarter, particularly in relation to other quarters.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3397||So what I'd like to do is highlight what was unique to Q4, including recent trends impacting our flow through, which primarily relates to two margin drivers within our Americas segment.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3398||The first driver relates to the investments we're making to sustain long-term growth exactly to your point.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3399||Along with the tax reform funded investments in partner wages and benefits that we initiated in fiscal 2018, we invested in additional labor hours in Q4 to build on our positive sales momentum drive higher levels of customer connection and explore opportunities to unlock capacity in stores that we believe are best positioned to capture incremental sales at peak.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3400||This effort tested the upper limits of investment potential to determine where the future payback could be greatest in terms of incremental sales.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3401||This investment was not intended to completely payback during the quarter.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3402||However, it provided us and this was our goal with a substantial amount of data.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3403||And we're leveraging these insights to optimize our labor deployment going forward.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3404||This is the artificial intelligence and machine learning that Kevin referred to earlier.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3405||So, in addition to those labor hours, we also invested in store-level equipment, as Roz mentioned, to support new product platforms like Nitro Cold Brew and to improve our operating efficiency.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3406||So that's the first driver, it’s really in the area of investment.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3407||The second driver relates to inflationary pressures in wages and benefits as well as occupancy expense.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3408||Now consistent with our discussion in Q3, we are seeing margin pressure from continued increases in statutory minimum wages coupled with inflationary increases in rent, culinary maintenance and real estate taxes.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3409||All that said we do expect modest margin expansion in fiscal 2020 as we've guided as we continue to balance our investments with expected benefits from sales leverage and ongoing cost savings initiatives notably in our supply chain.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3410||Now, I'd also like to take a minute or two to talk about China, because of the dynamics there are slightly different.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3411||We do expect to continue to make investments there in order to sustain strong comp growth even as we have accelerated our pace of development.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3412||But one thing that is slightly different is product mix.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3413||Product mix in the last year -- and we foresee this continuing into fiscal 2020 is a bit of a headwind in China.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3414||And one of the drivers of that is the growth in our delivery sales mix.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3415||As we've discussed before, delivery transactions are on the margin dilutive to our total margin.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3416||However, they are highly incremental.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3417||So even while diluting our margin percentage, they grow total profit dollars.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3418||And that is different from what we are seeing in our U.S. where delivery is in the very early stages and growing more immodesty.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3419||So that is probably the key difference between China and the U.S.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3420||But what is consistent across both and is an important part of our strategy going forward is continuing to make those strategic investments in our business that strengthen key points of competitive difference and help us to sustain top line growth for the long term.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3421||But it does come at the expense of what would otherwise be much stronger margin expansion on the back of the consistent comp growth that we're expecting going forward.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer

3428||Even as I listened to this call, it sounds like there is an interesting contrast where China's more of a digital flywheel story with that 45% growth in rewards and you had that big jump up in digital order partly fueled by delivery.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|David Palmer|question
3429||In the U.S., you've had that mid-teens growth in rewards users.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|David Palmer|question

3436||I do think that while we're focused on the same key things to create a great experience in our stores to drive beverage innovation that's relevant to our customers and to grow digital customer relationships the two markets are very different.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Kevin Johnson|answer
3437||Clearly, in China this past year, we've seen a significant step forward in our digital customer relationships.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Kevin Johnson|answer

3440||We launched Starbucks Delivers.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Kevin Johnson|answer
3441||And in China what you see is the consumer base in China is much more digitally savvy than any other market in the world.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Kevin Johnson|answer

3444||And so the work that Belinda and Leo and our great China leadership team did this year in many ways was anchored around taking a big step forward in the digital flywheel.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Kevin Johnson|answer
3445||And that's where a year ago we didn't have mobile ordering for pickup or delivery.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Kevin Johnson|answer
3446||Now 10% of our sales mix is coming from that with seven points from Starbucks Delivers and three for mobile order for pickup.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Kevin Johnson|answer

3449||But I think more importantly, the work that's gone into creating -- elevating the customer experience in our stores and really sharpening our focus on the beverage innovation, while at the same time expanding digital customer relationships has helped.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Kevin Johnson|answer

3501||First, I'm actually just going to stay on the Global Coffee Alliance.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|John Ivankoe|question
3502||I think, what you said, there's a 7% to 8% reduction in revenue relative to some things that happened in 2019.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|John Ivankoe|question
3503||I was just hoping you could talk about that.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|John Ivankoe|question

3505||Just overall from a profitability perspective as we think about that segment was fiscal 2020 in line with relative to what you originally thought?|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|John Ivankoe|question

3507|| Pat, why don't you take that, if you could?|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Kevin Johnson|answer
3508|| Certainly, so John, what I'd like to highlight is what is driving the difference between our total revenue growth guidance for fiscal 2020, and our long-term growth model.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3509||So we've guided to a range of 6% to 8%.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3510||Our long-term growth model is 7% to 9%.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3511||That one percentage point difference is attributable to two things.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3512||One is the sale of our ownership interest in Thailand in fiscal 2019, and how that extends then, with its impact into fiscal 2020.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3513||But then the second is, and I think this is more directly to your question, what we're expecting by way of a revenue decline in Channel Development from fiscal 2019, into fiscal 2020, even though we had lapped, the onset of the Global Coffee Alliance.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3514||There were some temporary business transition activities, in fiscal 2019.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3515||And that are non-recurring.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3516||And they tend to mask the growth profile of our Channel Development business for fiscal 2020.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3517||And they relate primarily to lapping some elevated inventory sales to Nestlé in preparation for their direct fulfilment of customer orders, in addition to, what were some final sales of Tazo-branded products that fell into fiscal 2019.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3518||So, when you normalize for these temporary transition items in Channel Development and as well as for the ownership change in Thailand, we get back to a normalized total revenue growth rate of 7% to 9%.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3519||What I would like to highlight specifically in relation to Channel Development, given that we are guiding to an adjusted revenue growth rate of 4%, which is at the bottom end of our ongoing range of 4% to 6% is that, we would expect it to be 4% to 5% in the near-term and then 5% to 6% longer term with what we expect by way of an accelerated pace of international market expansion.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3520||So really what you see happening is a combination of things.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3521||Number one, it's overlapping some unusual benefits that we realized in fiscal 2019.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer

3574||So I first want to clarify what's happening with breakage.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3575||As a reminder we adopted this new revenue recognition accounting standard starting in first quarter fiscal 2019.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer

3579||But I also want to clarify that breakage is not accounted for in comp sales.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3580||It's just another revenue driver after new stores and comp sales.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer

3584||And that's a function of the sales leverage that we expect from the comp growth that we're guiding in the range of 3% to 4% as well as the significant cost savings that we're expecting, particularly in our supply chain, and that that will be sufficient to offset the investments that we're looking to make in fiscal 2020 to continue to drive the top line.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3585||I will also say that the Americas margin will benefit in 2020 -- fiscal 2020 from the lap of the leadership conference in the fourth quarter.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3586||So as you think about the shape of our margin performance across the year, what that means is it will probably be flattish in Q1.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer
3587||We'll see that modest improvement in Q2 and Q3, and then we will see a very robust margin improvement in the fourth quarter.|SBUX|Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  4:30 PM ET|Pat Grismer|answer

3724||We believe our core value propositions of launching something new and connecting with what’s happening on Twitter continue to resonate with advertisers and a slower business over this summer was in part due to a relatively lighter slate of big events and launches in July and August compared to 2018.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|presentation
3725||One example of this is comparing the Men’s World Cup in 2018 with the Women’s World Cup in 2019.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|presentation

(NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|presentation
3728||Specifically, we expect the moderate performance in MAP and issues discussed in our personalization and data settings will likely result in four or more points of reduced year-over-year growth for total revenue in Q4 from three or more points of impact in Q3, reflecting a full quarter impact in Q4 versus only a partial quarter impact in Q3.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|presentation

3741||I have two.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Douglas Anmuth|question
3742||First just Ned on MAP, could you just help us understand a little bit more about kind of when you learned of the issues around MAP, around targeting and then sharing data and then the degree to which they’ve been fixed at this point and how that kind of informs the four points of impact that you’re talking about for 4Q?|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Douglas Anmuth|question
3743||And then secondly, it looks like you’re on track to do nearly the 20% OpEx outlook that you’ve discussed for this year, and I know it's early.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Douglas Anmuth|question
3744||But do you expect the same big four investment priorities next year and how do you think about OpEx growth for 2020?|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Douglas Anmuth|question
3745||Thanks.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Douglas Anmuth|question
3746|| Okay.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3747||Thanks, Doug.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3748||I'll take both.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3749||Jack can add anything afterwards, if it makes sense.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3750||First on the question on the product related issues.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3751||So these came up over the course of the quarter and it wasn’t one particular day, there were more than one of these things.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3752||Let me give you a couple of examples, which can help them come to life.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3753||The first is, we asked people a series of questions when we put them – before we put you into a timeline when you are new to Twitter.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3754||Among the questions, we asked our - if we can use your device settings to figure out the best ads to show you.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3755||It turns out that that setting wasn’t working as expected and we were using device settings even if people had asked us not to do so.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3756||So when we discovered that, when we tweeted about it which we often do to try to be transparent with people when things aren’t working as expected.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3757||And two, we turned off the setting, so that it would work as expected.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3758||That has a negative impact to revenue, because it’s one less input you’ve got, when you are figuring out which ads to show people.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3759||So instead of getting a partial quarter impact, you get a full quarter impact in Q4.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3760||A second example is specific to MAP, where we typically will share data with measurement partners who will then share with advertisers, so that they can see the effectiveness of their campaigns, not just on Twitter, but across platforms.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3761||And another one of the questions that we ask people before we put them into a timeline, is if we can share their data with measurement partners.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3762||That setting also was not working as expected and we were passing on data, which we have not intended to.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3763||So, we stopped doing that and although we are working on remediation, there isn’t remediation yet in place, and so the effects of that will continue into Q4.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3764||As you can imagine, the remediation would be sharing aggregated data, as opposed to personalized data when people have asked us not to share their data.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3765||So those are two good examples which hopefully helped the issues come to life a little bit, but this wasn't one thing, there were things that we found out over the course of the quarter and then when you get a full quarter’s impact of them even if you’re working to remediate there can be negative impact to revenue.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3766||Secondly, you asked about expenses and although it’s too early to talk about 2020, I just point back to some of the comments in the letter and in our opening remarks where we look at the things that we saw this quarter, both the DAU growth and the issues on the revenue product side and they really reinforce our strategy.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3767||We are really pleased with our hiring this quarter, retention was better than it has been and our ability to attract people to Twitter to come work here was better than it has been.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3768||So we continue to believe we can grow head count 20% or more and that expenses will grow about 20% as we’ve talked about in the past.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3769||So, no real changes there and as we think about next year, we think about a similar set of priorities from a big picture perspective, but it’s too early to lay out our specific plans or think about how that will all play out.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3770||But do keep in mind that we hope that all the people we’ve hired this year will stay with us next year.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3771||We hope that we will give merit increases to people who get promoted and cost of living increases and so on and so there is a natural increase to expenses, just based on decisions that have already been made.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3772|| Thank you, Ned.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Douglas Anmuth|question
3773|| Thank you.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Krista Bessinger|answer

3779||First, just when we looked at the – you know, I think Ned said nearly half of - or Jack Sorry, you said nearly half of the user growth came from product refinements.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Lloyd Walmsley|question
3780||Can you just give us a sense for where the other half, If I understood that correctly came from?|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Lloyd Walmsley|question
3781||And then when you look at the acceleration in DAU growth, do you have any sense for how much of that is coming from the better on-boarding specifically, you know, you started to talk about that something you’re investing in, but I think it was more of a 2020 focus.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Lloyd Walmsley|question
3782||So do you still feel like it's early innings in your ability to drive product improvement faster on-boarding in DAU growth?|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Lloyd Walmsley|question
3783|| Thanks, Lloyd.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer

3785||So we typically talk about three levers when we think about ways that we can bring people to Twitter, give them a great experience and help it become part of their daily lives.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3786||The first one is product improvements.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3787||You mentioned Jack's comments.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3788||Well, that was almost half of the improvement over a longer period of time.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3789||When we make product improvements they compound over time, the people who are new to Twitter this quarter benefited from all the product work that we’ve done over the last many years and watching that compound, watching the pace of our innovation improve and watching how we continue to drive better relevance, whether it’s around notifications or the home timeline or on-boarding, it's great to see the real impact that that’s having.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3790||The second one are the events that are happening all around the world, that drive people to the service.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3791||Now if we don't give them a good experience when they get there, they are going to leave and may not come back or may not come back for some time.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3792||So these are opportunities that are at best for us, but events are - they continue to be a driver when we think about ways that we’re adding people to the service.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3793||The third one, which is smaller, but is still an important lever is marketing, the marketing is a great way to bring people to service, but again it all comes back to the product, because if we don’t give people a good experience when they get there, they may not come back as frequently as we’d like.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer

3909||As you discovered some of the product issues through the quarter, did you reduce the amount of inventory in the auction that could go against MAP as an ad product or did you see people adjust their bidding and the prices dropped on MAP adds as people became aware of the problem?|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Eric Sheridan|question
3910||And then you highlighted the dynamic between MAP pricing and video pricing, but if video becomes a bigger portion of the mix and people get more familiarity with it.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Eric Sheridan|question

3917||So we didn’t make any changes.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3918||One of the great things about having an auction based service is that things adjust naturally.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3919||And so if there is less demand from one type of ad format or fewer inputs for advertisers across different formats, they'll use other inputs that bid the right - the price that makes sense for them.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3920||And sometimes things move from one format to another and other times advertisers pause and wait for things to change before they come back or they take their campaign elsewhere.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3921||If you step back and look at the metrics that we’ve share, you see our engagements increased about 23% that continues to grow greater than DAU which tells you that we’re selling better formats that we’re selling more relevant ads or putting more relevant ads in front of people, so pleased about that.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3922||And then cost for ad engagement was down 12%.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3923||That largely reflects a mix shift from MAP to video, really would think more about that than I would about changes around for like pricing.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3924||When you think about ad formats and opportunities around these just generally, there is still lots of opportunity for us to continue to improve relevance, to continue to come out with better ad formats and improved versions of our existing ad formats like MAP.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer

3927||As you’d imagine on a service like Twitter, the completion rates for video ads that are 6 seconds are much better, they are much more effective for the advertiser, they’re much more compelling for the person watching them that knows that are 15 seconds or longer.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer

3965||Could you quantify the impact in the revenue missed this quarter between the product mishaps in seasonality, what percentage of the shortfall was due to one versus the other.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Mark Mahaney|question
3966||Secondly, MAP products -like what percentage of ad revenue would you think that they account for.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Mark Mahaney|question
3967||And third, the seasonality doesn't really seem like it seasonality, it seems like it's more there is a new term for it or we need to come up with one like eventuality or something, you just didn't have a large number of traffic driving or interest driving events and therefore, you had a bit of a shortfall, maybe that's just part of Twitter going forwards, if you have big events, World Cup or political elections or whatever you have, you're going to have more traffic.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc.

3970||Just help us think through the dependency of the business, the ads business, the ad revenue business on having key events, it seems pretty straightforward, that seems like the issue rather than seasonality?|TWTR|Twitter, Inc.

3977||It is not an area where we've seen as much strength in the recent past, as we continue to work to come out with a new version of it, we think that that will give us, not just a better opportunity around mobile application promotion, but also around more direct response advertising more broadly because the same work in helping people launch campaigns faster, around doing better targeting, around more compelling formats and ultimately fewer impressions to realize their objectives are the same things that should help with more down the funnel advertising.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer
3978||Then, your second question was around the new term that you came up with, I don't think I think about it as just about the events that happened.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Ned Segal|answer

4009||Just, Ned, to kind of go back to that question on the auction market and sort of the changes that you saw, given that you talked about how just sort of it naturally adjusted and advertiser demand adjusted.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Brian Nowak|question
4010||How should we think about the steps, you have to take in order to improve the overall auction bidding density, whether it is fixing specific bugs or getting different sets of data as you try to kind of work your way through the headwind into 2020 and how long will that take?|TWTR|Twitter, Inc.

4015||So, first one you step back, we still feel like we're more demand constrained and supply constrained when we look across the service, across surface areas, across geographies, across times of year.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jack Dorsey|answer
4016||So continuing to make the case to advertisers, we're in $125 to $130 billion digital ads market that grows 20% a year, that they should launch more new products and services and invest more against those launches on Twitter that they should do more to connect with what's happening on Twitter.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jack Dorsey|answer
4017||One way to think about it is if you go back to the Super Bowl, we had 30 of the 38 advertisers from the Super Bowl on Twitter at the same time, but there are 8 to whom we still need to make the case, that they ought to be on Twitter.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jack Dorsey|answer

(NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jack Dorsey|answer

4021||So our MAP work should lead to more direct response type opportunities over time.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jack Dorsey|answer
4022||And in terms of bringing more advertisers to the service, we have a nice business where we help smaller advertisers in reaching their customers on Twitter.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jack Dorsey|answer
4023||But that's not an area that we have prioritized improvements around in the recent past.|TWTR|Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET|Jack Dorsey|answer

(NYSE:UAA) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call November  4, 2019  8:30 AM ET|Patrik Frisk|presentation

4201||I wanted to start by digging into the change in revenue guidance a little bit.|UAA|Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call November  4, 2019  8:30 AM ET|Alexandra Walvis|question
4202||So, you give three key reasons for the slightly lower revenue guide.|UAA|Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call November  4, 2019  8:30 AM ET|Alexandra Walvis|question
4203||Could you possibly help us to size each of those in terms of its magnitude on the change?|UAA|Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call November  4, 2019  8:30 AM ET|Alexandra Walvis|question
4204||And then, perhaps more specifically, on the North America backdrop as part of the driver of the lower guide, can you help us perhaps explain what's changed since we spoke last quarter in terms of outlet traffic or in terms of that online conversion which is weighing on sales growth a little bit?|UAA|Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call November  4, 2019  8:30 AM ET|Alexandra Walvis|question
4205|| Sure Alex.|UAA|Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call November  4, 2019  8:30 AM ET|David Bergman|answer

4207||First of all, relative to the updated guidance, we did talk about the three main drivers there.|UAA|Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call November  4, 2019  8:30 AM ET|David Bergman|answer
4208||Availability of excess inventory for the off-price channel is lower than we anticipated, also the weaker expectations on DTC and also the foreign exchange rates.|UAA|Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call November  4, 2019  8:30 AM ET|David Bergman|answer
4209||Quite frankly, all three of those are fairly similar in impact for us as we finish out the year.|UAA|Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call November  4, 2019  8:30 AM ET|David Bergman|answer
4210||There is not one that's really driving larger than the other relative to the updated guidance in Q4.|UAA|Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call November  4, 2019  8:30 AM ET|David Bergman|answer
4211||When we think about North America, in Q3, with the down 4%, the largest driver was the decline in the lower sales to the off-price channel.|UAA|Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call November  4, 2019  8:30 AM ET|David Bergman|answer
4212||DTC was a little weaker than expected, but then on the flipside, we were able to overdeliver a little bit on the wholesale side, some of that with the operational improvements we're driving.|UAA|Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call November  4, 2019  8:30 AM ET|David Bergman|answer
4213||And when you think about Q4, obviously, we're implying a higher growth rate in Q4.|UAA|Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call November  4, 2019  8:30 AM ET|David Bergman|answer
4214||Some of that is the service level improvements that we mentioned and being able to ship more of that spring product earlier in Q4 than previous Q4 in 2018, but also some of the DTC improvements to a degree.|UAA|Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call November  4, 2019  8:30 AM ET|David Bergman|answer
4215||The new commercial door concepts, which we're excited about, the amplified marketing that we've talked about, improved e-com fulfillment levels, and then also just having an easier comp for Q4 for North America as well.|UAA|Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call November  4, 2019  8:30 AM ET|David Bergman|answer

4222||The continued stabilization and strengthening of the foundation, which gives us an opportunity to reinvest into the brand earlier than we had originally planned, which is very exciting for us, and we also feel very strongly about the actual content that we're going to deliver against that.|UAA|Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call November  4, 2019  8:30 AM ET|Patrik Frisk|answer

4232||Is it a better full price sell-through perhaps in the wholesale channel or is it kind of better supply chain operations than you had previously expected?|UAA|Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call November  4, 2019  8:30 AM ET|Alexandra Walvis|question

4240||And then, ultimately, that then gives you less returns, right?|UAA|Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call November  4, 2019  8:30 AM ET|Patrik Frisk|answer

4448||And a lot of that starts with leadership.|UAA|Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call November  4, 2019  8:30 AM ET|Patrik Frisk|answer

4877||Morning, as we think about what the forward curve is telling us, and obviously it's been quite a volatile outlook for the forward curve, and some of the momentum that you talked about on the growth side in lending.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Erika Najarian|question
4878||As we think about the 6% NII decline in 2019, given sort of the forward curve plus that momentum, how should we think about NII decline expectations for 2020?|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Erika Najarian|question
4879|| Yes, well, it's complicated, because there's a lot of things going into it include where rates go versus what the market is suggesting, what happens with loan pricing, deposit pricing, and a variety of things, but if we, in the various scenarios that we run thinking about, let's say, the 9/30 implied forward curve, which suggests Fed funds in the 170 area, 12/31 of this year the 10-year just under 170, and then a year forward, Fed funds in the 120 area and Fed funds still in the 170 -- pardon me, 10-year still in the 170 area.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|John Shrewsberry|answer

4882|| Got it.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Erika Najarian|question
4883||And my second question, obviously you can't speak for the new CEO.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Erika Najarian|question
4884||The questions that we're getting from your investor base is that they're trying to gauge how much further investment there needs to be sort of going forward.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Erika Najarian|question
4885||And you mentioned yourself, John, that the investments in risk compliance and data had exceeded your expectations.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Erika Najarian|question
4886||And again, you can't speak for Charlie, but as you think about how those investments played out relative to investments in, let's say, innovation, and as you think about where you are versus peers, is there a significant catch-up gap because you've spent a lot of those dollars on risk compliance and data, how should we think about investment spend from here?|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Erika Najarian|question
4887|| Yes, so I think when Charlie arrives, we'll conduct a complete strategic review of where all the businesses stand and where we -- what our opportunities are, et cetera, including a review of how we've been investing on the risk compliance side, et cetera, and then formulate a view going forward.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Allen Parker|answer
4888||One thing that probably doesn't get enough focus is that a lot of the money and time that we've spent on the risk and control side of things really does enable further innovation.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Allen Parker|answer
4889||So, the money we spend in technology and data, for example, has huge customer impact down the road.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Allen Parker|answer
4890||So, there's not an either or necessarily, there's a lot of mutual benefit from running a more controlled environment.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Allen Parker|answer
4891||But that will be work that we all do together with Charlie after he arrives and then present conclusions at the right time.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Allen Parker|answer

4897|| John, sort of a follow-up question on costs, I guess if I look at the reiterated 2019 expense guide, it implies a pretty meaningful downdraft in costs in the 4Q, maybe if you could just take a moment to go through sort of the puts and takes and how you bring costs down in the coming quarter?|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Scott Siefers|question
4898||And then just along the lines of costs into 2020, I know you had previously suggested that costs could be flat in 2020, is that still something you're thinking or now with Charlie coming on board, do we sort of just sort of wait till he comes on and take a look at things, and then give him complete discretion on what the cost outlook looks like?|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Scott Siefers|question
4899|| Yes, so on the second half, I think you answered that, which is we should wait and allow him to have an input onto the composition of how we're spending money in the future.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|John Shrewsberry|answer
4900||For Q4 though, as you pointed out, it does imply a step down.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|John Shrewsberry|answer
4901||And I think the biggest sources of that are other professional fees and some labor-related expense.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|John Shrewsberry|answer
4902||But it does require that, that’s how the math works, and that's how we're forecasted right now.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|John Shrewsberry|answer
4903|| Okay, perfect, thank you.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Scott Siefers|question
4904||And then just separately on mortgage, I think you had said that the originations should stay around this quarter's level into the fourth quarter.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Scott Siefers|question
4905||Hopefully, I heard that correctly.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Scott Siefers|question
4906||Maybe if you could just sort of comment on where you see gain on sale margins trending with a nice uptick this quarter?|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Scott Siefers|question
4907||And overall, given the moving parts that you see, should we expect mortgage revenues to be at or above what we saw this quarter, particularly if we don't get the same sort of MSR noise?|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Scott Siefers|question
4908|| Yes, so on the origination side, it's hard to say what the full quarter gain on sale is, but we do think it'll be in the neighborhood of where it's been recently, it was just, call it, 120 basis points, which was a big tick up and welcome.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Allen Parker|answer
4909||On the servicing side, well I wouldn't expect there to be any revaluation in the fourth quarter.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Allen Parker|answer
4910||We think we’ve got that in the third quarter.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Allen Parker|answer
4911||We -- recall that we are in a flatter curve environment, and so the carry for holding treasuries is a hedge to the MSR.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Allen Parker|answer
4912||Sometimes, it works for us in a steeper curve environment, and sometimes it's either neutral or works against us when the curve gets flatter.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Allen Parker|answer
4913||So we shouldn't earn as much on the hedge but we probably wouldn't have the type of valuation items we saw in Q3.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Allen Parker|answer

4921||With the deposit cost increases slowing, might we have seen kind of the end of the deposit cost rise for you guys this quarter assuming rates stay flat to down from here, kind of just trying to think if this could be the max paying quarter for NIM where you had the deposit costs up and loan yields down, and maybe some just puts and takes for the fourth quarter on NIM versus this quarter?|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|John McDonald|question
4922|| Yes, so my expectation is that deposit costs will be cheaper in the fourth quarter reflecting what you described in terms of kind of the burning out of the higher cost deposits that got layered in before the Fed began to ease.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|John Shrewsberry|answer
4923||Having said that, that is still -- there was less room to go down on the deposit side, and so if rates continue to move down on the asset side it still works against us even if deposit costs aren't rising.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|John Shrewsberry|answer
4924||So we have to be as vigilant as we can to keep deposits costs as low as it makes sense for the businesses and customers that we serve.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|John Shrewsberry|answer

4935|| Yes, I think it's a good point, there's a real opportunity for, for taking best-in-class and then making it much more efficient.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|John Shrewsberry|answer
4936||I think we should -- maybe it was last quarter, one of the things that we mentioned is that we're building a control environment for the company as it exists today, and there is just through process consolidation and process reengineering, there's an opportunity for the company to be a whole lot more simplified as we roll forward, and both the cost of delivery and the cost of overseeing that from a risk and control perspective would be expected to be more efficient.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|John Shrewsberry|answer

4941||Hey, John, one follow-up on the NII side, so you keeping their minus 6 NII I got for the year kind of gets you 11 fours for the year, and down even five next year kind of holds you at that 11 four-ish, and so I know there're so many potential permutations of what happens with the rate environment, but maybe you can just help us talk through how much you expect the balance sheet to grow then, or how -- versus how close you're starting to get towards the asset cap, and what constraints if anything, might you have as this gets further out?|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Ken Usdin|question
4942||Thanks.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Ken Usdin|question
4943|| I mean within the relevant range of expectations of loan and deposit growth, I wouldn't think of the asset cap as being as really coming into play in our forecast horizon, in part, because there are plenty of levers that we can pull that don't have real customer impact in terms of consumers and our business customers, and we've talked about some of those before in terms of some of the institutional deposits that we take or other wholesale funding that we use, and then, there are some assets that don't work that hard for us from a balance sheet perspective.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|John Shrewsberry|answer
4944||So, I guess the low single-digit growth rates for loans and deposits is probably a reasonable proxy for a reasonable placeholder for thinking about how 2020 unfolds, could be a range of different outcomes, but that would be consistent with what I mentioned earlier in terms of how you might forecast the different rate paths and getting to a low to mid single-digits down percentage in net interest income for 2020 versus 2019.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|John Shrewsberry|answer

4947|| Yes, well, so with IRT, I think we actually have a -- this page in the back of the supplement that shows you exactly what to expect there, and not to oversimplify it, but it's on the order of $100 million a quarter I think from both revenue and expense, at least as we process it.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|John Shrewsberry|answer
4948||Estill coming out starting in the fourth quarter, it was probably a little bit bigger in terms of dollars of revenue per quarter, and you'll see it mostly in the commercial mortgage brokerage line item in the P&L, it shows up in a couple of others areas too and have investment banking fees, but similarly the expenses approximate the revenue in our own experience.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|John Shrewsberry|answer

4961||And so we really have to pick our spots in order to maintain our risk reward, credit and pricing and loan terms quality, and it's also one of those areas where, frankly, your weakest loans end up getting refinanced away from you, which is also late cycle behavior by the way, so we're still very comfortable with what we have on the books, but I wouldn't look for it to grow meaningfully until the cycle turns and until our best customers have really interesting opportunities to put their own capital to work and we help them do it.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Allen Parker|answer
4962||So I could be wrong, but it feels to me like it's going to be treading water while our best customers either refinance deals that were already in or prudently take advantage of what the market offers them.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Allen Parker|answer

4972||The other thing that contributes to is we had a change in accounting a year or so ago which is causing us to recognize unrealized gains where they said there's a subsequent capital raise in a private deal that causes us to have to mark up our position, and it's always been true if one of those companies goes public, but our affiliate still ends up owning shares for a period of time that we write up, we recognize the gain even though we haven't liquidated our position.|WFC|Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2019 11:00 AM ET|Allen Parker|answer
